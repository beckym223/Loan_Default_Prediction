# Title

## Introduction to data
Where we got it, what it's used for

## Data Validation and Exploration
- Graphs, checking conditions
- Preprocessing steps
- 

## Model Selection
Why we're choosing this model

## Data processing/model training/cross validation
- Basic model
    - CV shows that we don't need to worry about overfitting but the model is not very good
- Undersampled model
    - Graph of proportion vs precision/recall
- Polynomial features and selection model
    - Graph of n_features vs. precision/recall

## Interpretation and evaluation of results
Feature importance, precision/recall, how it's working

## Ethical discussion

## Conclusion
